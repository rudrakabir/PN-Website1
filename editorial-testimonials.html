<p>Pallavi Narayan is a literary surgeon. She scalpels language with utmost precision and treats her sentences with compassion and care.
    <b>—Kiran Bhat, author, we of the forsaken world…</b></p>
    
    <p>I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for your invaluable assistance in editing the final version of my manuscript. I can only imagine how hectic your schedule must have been, and yet, you dedicated your time and expertise to help me refine my work. 
    … I must say that your efforts have made a significant difference. Your meticulous editing and insightful feedback have undoubtedly improved the quality of my writing, and for that, I am truly thankful. … I have every confidence that your contributions will greatly enhance [the manuscript’s] chances of success. … If you have the availability and are willing to take on the task of editing [a] new project, I would be delighted to work with you again. Thank you once more for your outstanding work and collaboration throughout the process. It has been a pleasure to work with you, and I look forward to the possibility of future collaborations. 
    <b>—Kishore Ram, author, The Dead Know Nothing (Penguin Random House India)</b></p>
    
    
    <p>Pallavi was the editor for the book Beyond the Apsara: Celebrating Dance in Cambodia [Routledge] which was launched at the World Dance Alliance conference in New Delhi in November 2009. This was my first attempt at publishing a book for which I was co-editor along with Stephanie Burridge of Singapore. I could not have asked for or dreamed of a better collaborator than Pallavi. Her patience, professionalism and infectious enthusiasm for our publication inspired all of us to move forward in what could have been an arduous process but instead was a joy. I am eternally grateful to Pallavi’s incredible contribution to this work and very much look forward to another opportunity to collaborate with her!
    <b>—Fred Frumberg, Deputy Director, Program Management, Center for the Art of Performance, UCLA</b></p>
    
    <p>I have just got my copies of Traversing Tradition: Celebrating Dance in India [Routledge] yesterday. The book has come out really well, has a really impressive get-up, and the photos have come out really well. I must thank you for your hard and intense work throughout the editing process. Without you it would not have been possible to bring together so many writings from so many people with such different ways of writing. I appreciate the way in which you have done the work of a coordinator as well as a copy-editor. The editing of the book is great, and it was so wonderful to work with you. 
    <b>—Urmimala Sarkar Munsi, Professor, School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University</b></p>
    
    
    <p>Pallavi—thanks for your wonderful work on this and it will be great to see it all come together. Thanks again for your diligent work and effort on the series. … It looks beautiful …
    …
    My gratitude and thanks for Pallavi … for bringing it [Traversing Tradition: Celebrating Dance in India] onto the page—I know without the intense local knowledge and passion for dance that you bring to this series, this book in particular would have been much more challenging. Huge thanks again.
    <b>—Stephanie Burridge, Series Editor, Celebrating Dance in Asia and the Pacific (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi—thank you for sending the flier for me to look at it. I am just so delighted to see such a beautiful flier … it looks handsomely good. … I would not mind bringing some of the fliers back to Kuala Lumpur to be distributed to schools and colleges and dance aficionados as well as would-be patrons for our book launch. I have nothing else to add, it is a beautiful piece of artwork. 
    <b>—Mohd Anis Md Nor, Managing Director and Research Fellow, NusPARC and former Professor, Ethnochoreology and Ethnomusicology, Cultural Centre (School of Performing Arts), University of Malaya, editor of Sharing Identities: Celebrating Dance in Malaysia  (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>Thanks for taking care of the proofs personally—with your touch and care, I am sure it will be a beautiful book. I am eagerly looking forward to seeing the book in print.
    <b>—Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt, Professor, Resource, Environment & Development Program, Crawford School of Public Policy, The Australian National University and co-editor of Doing Gender, Doing Geography: Emerging Research in India (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>I’ve gone through my paper again carefully. You all have done superb work.
    <b>—Pallabi Sil, contributor to Doing Gender, Doing Geography: Emerging Research in India (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>I read my chapter carefully. Surprisingly, I could not find any mistake—typo, grammatical or otherwise. So “go ahead” from my end.
    <b>—Sanjeer Alam, Assistant Professor, Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), contributor to Doing Gender, Doing Geography: Emerging Research in India (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>The book package was just delivered to my door and I was happily here to receive it, … I opened it immediately and was delighted by the look and feel of it. Thank you for making such a wonderful book. You are great, Pallavi. So glad to work with such miracle workers with problem solving. Thank you for being so very good to work with over these thousands of miles and for all you have done to help Asha [Hans] and me bring our book to life. I certainly hope we will meet one day.
    <b>—Late Betty Reardon, Founding Director Emeritus, International Institute on Peace Education (IIPE) and co-editor of The Gender Imperative: Human Security vs State Security (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>I have received my complimentary copy of The Gender Imperative: Human Security vs State Security (Routledge). It looks terrific. I hope promotion goes well, as it is a timely book which should be widely read.
    <b>—Lisa S. Price, Professor, Anthropology, Oregon State University and contributor</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi was the editor at Routledge for my book Tracking the Media: Interpretations of Mass Media Discourses in India and Pakistan [Routledge]. She was thoroughly professional and did an excellent job. It was a pleasure working on the book with her.
    <b>—Subarno Chattarji, Professor, University of Delhi</b></p>
    
    <p>We have gone through the proofs carefully. Most of the changes/corrections are quite minor. Obviously, your office has done an excellent job. 
    <b>—Autar S. Dhesi, Retired Professor of Economics and co-editor of Rural Development in Punjab: A Success Story Going Astray (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>Many thanks indeed for sending me a copy of Grounding Morality: Freedom, Knowledge and the Plurality of Cultures [Routledge], which arrived yesterday. It is an impressively produced volume, and I am glad indeed to receive it.
    <b>—Jonardon Ganeri, Professor, Department of Philosophy, University of Toronto</b></p>
    
    <p>The proofs [of An Alternative Idea of India: Tagore and Vivekananda, Routledge] had been remarkably well done and very few corrections were necessary.
    <b>—Gangeya Mukherji, independent scholar</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi, thank you for performing the job of copy-editing [Undermining Local Democracy: Parallel Governance in Contemporary South India, Routledge]. It is a job well done!
    <b>—Lalita Chandrashekhar, scholar</b></p>
    
    <p>I wanted to bring to your attention the absolutely fantastic work Pallavi Narayan has been doing and continues to do. Pallavi has been extremely meticulous in copyediting. We have corresponded on a regular basis, and very importantly, she has always reverted to me promptly. Pallavi has also followed up regularly and promptly with the artist, typesetter, PR, and Marketing. She has telephoned me whenever I have requested her to and clarified all matters. She has kept me abreast of all developments at all point of time. Consequently, Pallavi has ensured that I have not faced the stresses an author can face when people do not revert to them in a timely and appropriate fashion.
    It is in large measure Pallavi’s diligence, intelligence, promptness, efficiency and superb follow-up that has enabled the book to progress at this fast pace, and will (hopefully!) see it in print [very soon]. Thank you very much for having assigned her to oversee my book.
         I feel that I must bring this to your attention, since I am both impressed, and grateful, for Pallavi Narayan’s exceptional work.
    <b>—Shoma Munshi, Former Professor of Anthropology, American University of Kuwait and author, Prime Time Soap Operas on Indian Television (Routledge)</b></p>
     
    <p>The book’s production is really good, and it has been much appreciated by those who have seen it here. And the pictures have been well done. I must admit that it still has not sunk in completely that I have the book at last in its entirety ...! I would like to thank you for all your help with the book. And thank you for your patience and kind understanding.
    <b>—Manpreet Janeja, Associate Professor,  Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen and author, Transactions in Taste: The Collaborative Lives of Everyday Bengali Food (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>Thanks … for all your help in bringing the book out in such record time.
    <b>—Farhana Ibrahim, Professor of Sociology, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and author, Settlers, Saints and Sovereigns: An Ethnography of State Formation in Western India (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>Copies of the book reached me a couple of days ago. The production is excellent. Pallavi has been a
    responsive and helpful editor.
    <b>—Late Satish Saberwal, Professor of Sociology, Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University and author, Spirals of Contention: Why India was Partitioned in 1947 (Routledge)</b></p>
    
    <p>Thank you for the copy of Southern Postcolonialisms [The Global South and ‘New’ Literary Representations, Routledge]—it arrived yesterday. It looks very handsome and
    well put together. Congratulations!
    <b>—Rajeswari Sunder Rajan, Global Distinguished Professor, Faculty of Arts and Science, NYU and contributor</b></p>
    
    <p>Thank  you very much for all the trouble you have taken for our volume. I greatly appreciate all the
    meticulous care you have showered over it.
    <b>—Huricihan İslamoğlu, Professor of Economic History and Political Economy, Boğaziçi University and editor, Shared Histories of Modernity: China, India and the Ottoman Empire (Routledge)</b></p>

    <b>—Peter J. Carroll, Associate Professor and Director, Program of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, Department of History, Northwestern University and contributor</b></p>
    
    <p>The book (Shared Histories of Modernity) arrived yesterday.  It looks terrific.  Thank you very much.
    <b>—Melissa Macauley, School of Historical Studies, Institute for Advanced Study and contributor </b></p>
    
    <p>As a member of the editorial collective of SOUTHEAST OF NOW: Directions in Contemporary and Modern Art, I am writing to recommend the excellent work that Dr Pallavi has undertaken to guide us through the editorial process of putting the journal together. Dr Pallavi was the appointed acquisitions editor and National University of Singapore Press representative for the journal. She always advised with an innate understanding of her field. Dr Pallavi had help produce the clean copy, on deadline, and was very willing to provide additional information and clarify certain points as needed. In addition, Dr Pallavi takes great pride in her work, conducts herself professionally and is easy to work with.
    <b>—Simon Soon, Lecturer, Art History, University of Melbourne</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi was the editor of my book I Kissed A Frog (published by Pan Macmillan in 2013). She's one of the finest, most dedicated editors I have ever worked with. Be warned: her delicate appearance is deceptive—she's a tough customer. We'd have lengthy, animated debates over scintillating issues like the placement of commas—nothing was too small or too insignificant to ignore—and I think that's what I appreciated most about her. I would love to work with her on all my future projects, if possible. It's a great comfort to know that your manuscript is in the right hands.
    <b>—Rupa Gulab, author</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi was assigned to my novel published by Picador/Pan Macmillan. She was the perfect editor. I've worked with a few in my time from editorial directors to desk/copy editors and she's up there at the top of the chart. She was patient, helpful, calming—and very diplomatic. She’s a gift to authors and I'm sure an asset to her employers. I feel very lucky she was assigned to my book.
    <b>—Shahrukh Husain, author of A Restless Wind</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is an extremely intelligent, creative and empathetic editor who understands where a writer is coming from and edits the work accordingly. She has an eye for detail and the wonderful ability of working on a manuscript without preconceived notions or prejudices, which allows her to objectively get the best out of different styles and genres of writing. She works with an open mind, and is sensitive to the author's genuine concerns while never losing sight of her responsibilities as an editor. Her warm and friendly disposition and her obvious enthusiasm for her work made it easy for me, as one of her authors, to bond and work with her in a harmonious, efficient, productive manner - an experience that I truly appreciated and enjoyed. It would be my pleasure and privilege to work with her again.
    <b>—Sangeeta Bahadur, author of Jaal and Vikraal</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is a detail-oriented editor with remarkable skills in English grammar. She scrutinizes your manuscript like a hawk to ensure that it will turn out to be the finest it can possibly be.
    <b>—Reenita Malhotra Hora, novelist and screenwriter, author of Forever Young: Unleashing the Magic of Ayurveda (Pan Macmillan)</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is an extremely meticulous and discerning editor who is passionate about her work. Her editing is top-notch and it is quite clear that it comes from a deep understanding of the subject. She also gives space to the designers which is a truly rare quality.
    <b>—Pinaki De, Graphic Designer and Associate Professor, Raja Peary Mohan College, Uttarpara</b></p>
    
    <p>I remember Pallavi as a remarkable person and one of those pleasant people to work with. Her positive and professional attitude and outstanding work ethic makes her the perfect fit for any organization. She commissioned me to create indices for her organization and in our day-to-day interaction found her to possess an excellent knowledge and an outstanding editorial skill. Pallavi is an ultimate professional and a great person and copy editor to work with and I will also like to wish her all the best in all future endeavors.
    <b>—Amit Prasad, Freelance Indexer</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is a go-getter, she knows what she wants and she doesn’t stop until she gets it. Her attention to detail and her command over the language makes her an editorial asset. She is confident and has great networking skills, she can go up there and strike a conversation with anyone. 
    <b>—Ayushi Srivastava, Founder and CEO, Digital Growth Hackers</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is very professional in her work and meets all target commitments for any assignments that she takes on. We have been very impressed by the quality of the work she delivers on the projects that we outsourced to her.
    <b>—Arjun Sirur, Chairman & Managing Director, COTMAC</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is a brilliant editor and a senior one could always turn to at any point of time. She helped me find my footing in copy-editing along with the other seniors, and is also a lovely person. An extremely meticulous worker, she can handle a lot of responsibilities at the same time effortlessly.
    <b>—Aldeena Raju, Editor, Reference Works, Springer Nature</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is intelligent, she does her job with a lot of responsibility and commitment.
    <b>—Pankaj Bhardwaj, Commercial Director, F1000 (Taylor & Francis Group)</b></p>
    
    <p>Pallavi is very meticulous, organised and pays full attention to even minor issues concerning her performance as an editor. Pallavi's work has been appreciated by most of authors she worked and internally by her colleagues.
