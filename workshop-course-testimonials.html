    <p>The creative-non-fiction sessions with Pallavi at the Panchgani Writers Retreat were amazing. She is not only an exceptional instructor with deep knowledge of non-fiction writing, but is great in opening up so many different windows in our minds to explore this genre with our own individual style and context. Her sessions were very engaging with interesting activities, and she actually got us to produce some good writing ourselves during the retreat. Though I am more a poetry/flash fiction writer, her workshop has motivated me to seriously explore more non-fiction writing now.

<p>An amazing workshop that brought out the best or what we want to call our best in the future out in the open for us. Art truly shapes every aspect of life—thank you Pallavi for patiently listening and then highlighting what we really wanted to hear! A truly enriching experience.

    <p>Thank you Pallavi for the workshop and the insights. I learnt a lot and I think I am now a little clear as to how to start. Loved your informal approach. Seemed like usual conversations, but you made us cover a lot of things. Descriptive writing was good learning. Loads of work to be done now. Thank you once again.

    <p>Pallavi’s creative non-fiction workshop hosted by Bound India was well designed for wannabe writers and budding wordsmiths. It had an enjoyable balance of worldly classic references as well as a down-to-earth discussion on text analysis and cultural elements that I find both interesting and educational. There is enough reflection and challenge, as well as social connection so I feel engaged during the exercises and to the other participants. I highly recommend Pallavi’s workshop to anyone interested to improve their creative writing skills.

    <p>I did a non-fiction writing workshop with Dr Pallavi Narayan last week. It’s clearly evident from her energy that she comes from a place of passion and shares her expertise so generously. From writing habits and tools to types of non-fiction, some effective exercises/prompts to creative non-fiction … she packs in a punch across the four days of the workshop. Her approach is so encouraging that what started as an impulsive decision just to explore this workshop has now become a dream. I feel so invigorated after having done her class. Thank you Pallavi :)
    — Khushboo Ramnane, independent journalist, participant in creative non-fiction workshop</p>
    
    <p>Learning with fun, that’s what Pallavi’s sessions are. Clear takeaways, enough practice and a great participant interaction is what I really take back from the 4-session course on creative non-fiction writing. If that's an area that you want to build your skills in, you must check out her courses.
    — Gautam Gouthi, leadership coach, participant in creative non-fiction workshop</p>
    
    <p>I recommend Pallavi’s creative non-fiction classes where she introduces various elements and activities to make you a confident writer with a strong foundation. Constructive criticism helps you mould your skills better and Pallavi is a very prompt and intuitive Instructor.
    — Shreya Sudesh, participant in creative non-fiction workshop hosted by Bound India</p>
    
    <p>Participating in Pallavi’s lyrical essay workshop helped open up a rather narrow outlook towards literature at large. Despite the art form being quite alien to the average reader and writer, she made us feel comfortable enough to embrace it by the end of the class. Pallavi backed the sessions with solid research, reading material and writing exercises. Her feedback was kind, honest and precise. After just 8 hours with Pallavi, I have become a more fluid thinker. I look forward to continue learning from her.
    — Payal Morankar, Business writer, participant in lyrical essay workshop hosted by Bound India</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for being such a great teacher and for making learning fun! It is a privilege to learn from someone of [your] experience and stature. I have benefited so much from your teaching and encouragement.
    — Uma Shirodkar, translator and South Asia Speaks fellow</p>
    
    <p>Pallavi’s energy astounds me. She’s so full of knowledge. And the works she’s done! I’m in awe! There were so many things I didn’t know and didn’t think I needed to know. These sessions put me back in the student mode and I had the best learning experience so far.
    — Irfaana, Assistant Professor, St Joseph’s College</p>
    
    <p>The course and these classes have been a turning point in my writing career. Thank you for being our mentor and guide in this journey.
    — Rohee Dholakia, writer, poet, and translator, and educator, Mahatma Gandhi International School</p>
    
    <p>Pallavi’s tests really made me use my brain and I appreciate that so much! Even though we made so many errors … it was an awesome session. Thanks for making the sessions so fun! Here’s to the coolest instructor. The kind of things she’s achieved … I mean, just pure admiration for her.

    <p>Professor Dr Pallavi Narayan taught me Interdisciplinary Studies at the Jindal School of Liberal Arts and Humanities for one semester. Professor Pallavi was one of the best professors I have been taught by! She greatly encouraged participation, gave constructive feedback regularly, and was always available for a one-on-one tutoring or doubt-clearing session. Moreover, her knowledge is vast so class discussion often went beyond the subject at hand which made classes superbly engaging and informative!
    — Aaryan Panchal, Assistant Editor, Centre for Security Studies and former student</p>
    
    <p>Dr Pallavi Narayan has been a wonderful professor. She always ensured that the classes were interactive, which certainly gave us an in-depth understanding of whatever was taught. One of the things that stood out for me was that she conducted a few classes outdoors, which was an experience students will not forget anytime soon. Despite undergoing an accident, Dr. Pallavi Narayan, continued to conduct classes with the same enthusiasm and have a successful book launch. This will serve as an inspiration for me, for years to come.
    — Ritika Modi, Masters candidate, S.P. Jain School of Global Management and former student</p>
    
    <p>Dr Pallavi Narayan taught me a foundational course in an interdisciplinary seminar. She demonstrated a remarkable expression of how liberal arts education takes an interdisciplinary approach in its courses. We dealt with texts related to literary theory, arts, anthropology, sociology, and culture. Professor Pallavi has remarkable skills in academic writing and has actively mentored me as well as my fellow mates throughout the course. I was also privileged to be a part of her book launch during my first semester on campus. Professor also trained us to deal with different themes and bring up nuanced ideas for classroom discussions.
    — Cherin Gheervarghese, Masters candidate, SOAS, University of London and former student</p>
    
    <p>Dr Pallavi Narayan's approach as an educator is unique. She uses a combination of traditional lecture formats with more interactive discussion-based sessions that allow for deeper understanding. She always encouraged participation and shared feedback on our progress. Her classes challenged us intellectually but also provided a nurturing space for growth.

    — Nandini Mehta, student</p>
