    <p>The creative-non-fiction sessions with Pallavi at the Panchgani Writers Retreat were amazing. She is not only an exceptional instructor with deep knowledge of non-fiction writing, but is great in opening up so many different windows in our minds to explore this genre with our own individual style and context. Her sessions were very engaging with interesting activities, and she actually got us to produce some good writing ourselves during the retreat. Though I am more a poetry/flash fiction writer, her workshop has motivated me to seriously explore more non-fiction writing now.

      <p>An amazing workshop that brought out the best or what we want to call our best in the future out in the open for us. Art truly shapes every aspect of life—thank you Pallavi for patiently listening and then highlighting what we really wanted to hear! A truly enriching experience.

      <p>Thank you Pallavi for the workshop and the insights. I learnt a lot and I think I am now a little clear as to how to start. Loved your informal approach. Seemed like usual conversations, but you made us cover a lot of things. Descriptive writing was good learning. Loads of work to be done now. Thank you once again.

      <p>Pallavi’s creative non-fiction workshop hosted by Bound India was well designed for wannabe writers and budding wordsmiths. It had an enjoyable balance of worldly classic references as well as a down-to-earth discussion on text analysis and cultural elements that I find both interesting and educational. There is enough reflection and challenge, as well as social connection so I feel engaged during the exercises and to the other participants. I highly recommend Pallavi’s workshop to anyone interested to improve their creative writing skills.

      <p>I did a non-fiction writing workshop with Dr Pallavi Narayan last week. It’s clearly evident from her energy that she comes from a place of passion and shares her expertise so generously. From writing habits and tools to types of non-fiction, some effective exercises/prompts to creative non-fiction … she packs in a punch across the four days of the workshop. Her approach is so encouraging that what started as an impulsive decision just to explore this workshop has now become a dream. I feel so invigorated after having done her class. Thank you Pallavi :)

      <p>Learning with fun, that’s what Pallavi’s sessions are. Clear takeaways, enough practice and a great participant interaction is what I really take back from the 4-session course on creative non-fiction writing. If that's an area that you want to build your skills in, you must check out her courses.

      <p>Participating in Pallavi’s lyrical essay workshop helped open up a rather narrow outlook towards literature at large. Despite the art form being quite alien to the average reader and writer, she made us feel comfortable enough to embrace it by the end of the class. Pallavi backed the sessions with solid research, reading material and writing exercises. Her feedback was kind, honest and precise. After just 8 hours with Pallavi, I have become a more fluid thinker. I look forward to continue learning from her.

      <p>Pallavi’s energy astounds me. She’s so full of knowledge. And the works she’s done! I’m in awe! There were so many things I didn’t know and didn’t think I needed to know. These sessions put me back in the student mode and I had the best learning experience so far.

      <p>Professor Dr Pallavi Narayan taught me Interdisciplinary Studies at the Jindal School of Liberal Arts and Humanities for one semester. Professor Pallavi was one of the best professors I have been taught by! She greatly encouraged participation, gave constructive feedback regularly, and was always available for a one-on-one tutoring or doubt-clearing session. Moreover, her knowledge is vast so class discussion often went beyond the subject at hand which made classes superbly engaging and informative!

      <p>Dr Pallavi Narayan has been a wonderful professor. She always ensured that the classes were interactive, which certainly gave us an in-depth understanding of whatever was taught. One of the things that stood out for me was that she conducted a few classes outdoors, which was an experience students will not forget anytime soon. Despite undergoing an accident, Dr. Pallavi Narayan, continued to conduct classes with the same enthusiasm and have a successful book launch. This will serve as an inspiration for me, for years to come.

      <p>Dr Pallavi Narayan taught me a foundational course in an interdisciplinary seminar. She demonstrated a remarkable expression of how liberal arts education takes an interdisciplinary approach in its courses. We dealt with texts related to literary theory, arts, anthropology, sociology, and culture. Professor Pallavi has remarkable skills in academic writing and has actively mentored me as well as my fellow mates throughout the course. I was also privileged to be a part of her book launch during my first semester on campus. Professor also trained us to deal with different themes and bring up nuanced ideas for classroom discussions.

      <p>Dr Pallavi Narayan's approach as an educator at the Jindal School of Liberal Arts and Humanities was exemplary. Through her teaching, she instilled critical thinking skills and engaged in discussions and dialogue within the classroom. She has expectational mentorship skills to connect with students beyond the confines of the classroom. She provided unwavering support with concrete feedback on essays that helped me tremendously to improve my academic writing throughout the semester. Moreover, I had the distinct pleasure of witnessing Dr Pallavi Narayan's outstanding work during her <i>Singapore at Home</i> book presentation at O.P. Jindal Global University. Her depth of knowledge and insights were truly remarkable, and her book served as an inspiration.

      <p>I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for taking the time to write me a letter of recommendation. Your support means a great deal to me, and I am truly thankful for your willingness to contribute to my academic and professional journey. I appreciate the effort and thought you put into crafting the recommendation letter. Your insights into my abilities and accomplishments have undoubtedly strengthened my application, and I am confident that your endorsement will make a positive impact. Your guidance and mentorship have been invaluable throughout my academic experience, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from you. Once again, thank you for your support and for being an influential figure in my academic and professional pursuits. 
      <b>—Rushali Aggarwal, Masters candidate, Columbia University and former student</b></p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the experience I had in your world literature course. Looking back, it was one of the most engaging and insightful classes I’ve taken, not just because of the readings but because of the way you taught them. Instead of simply delivering information, you created a space where discussions thrived. Your interactive approach—where you valued our perspectives and encouraged us to think beyond the text—made the learning experience truly enriching.
      One of the most fascinating aspects of the course was how we explored different cultural settings through literature. Each city we studied wasn’t just a backdrop but a living, breathing entity, shaped by history, people, and stories. And by the end of the semester, the course exhibition, where we mapped our readings onto a world map, tied everything together in such a creative and meaningful way. That final project really solidified how much we had travelled—through words—across different places and cultures.
      On a more personal note, that semester was particularly hectic for me, and I still remember when I requested an extension on a deadline. Instead of just granting it as a formality, you told me to take my time and submit it on Sunday instead of Thursday. It may have seemed like a small gesture, but to me, it was a huge reminder that I wasn’t just seen as a student churning out assignments—I was seen as a person with struggles and circumstances that were understood and accommodated. That kindness meant a lot.
      Outside the classroom, our interactions have continued in the same thoughtful and engaging way—whether it’s been crossing paths and having impromptu conversations or attending your book talks. It has been a privilege not just to learn from you in a formal setting but to also witness your journey as I navigate my own. What stands out the most is how you remember the little details, making every interaction feel genuine. The balance you maintain between professionalism and approachability is something I truly admire.
      So, thank you—not just for your teaching but for fostering an environment where learning felt dynamic, where students felt heard, and where mutual respect shaped the way we engaged. It has been an absolute pleasure, and I look forward to more such conversations in the future.

      <p>I am writing this email to express my gratitude and appreciation for the learning journey you took me on with The City in World Literature.  From the way you structured this unique course to the seamless flow of concepts you maintained, I was constantly intellectually stimulated by your course. You made literature accessible and were so receptive to our ideas and interpretations that the environment of the class was converted into a nurturing and collaborative space.  You always motivated us to think outside the box. I would like to particularly extend my gratitude outside the classroom where you graciously solved my doubts and introduced me to the literary field. Your willingness and enthusiasm to interact with students in and out of the classroom and convey the academic excellence of literature to us was truly touching.

      <p>Your approach to teaching in LIT301: City in World Literature has been both engaging and thought-provoking. Critical discussions and an inclusive learning environment created a classroom space where diverse perspectives were welcomed and valued. 
                The way you incorporated multiple authors and readings into discussions at every step of the way fostered my interest in literary studies. Even today, I go back to those references whenever necessary. The concepts we focused on in the classroom and your ability to connect these with real-world applications further enhanced the knowledge I gathered from the class. 
                I am grateful for your interactions outside class; they have been equally meaningful to me. Your ability to engage and provide insightful perspectives to the varied set of questions I had throughout the course period has made learning an ongoing process beyond formal lectures. I sincerely thank you for your dedication and for introducing me to the side of literature that was completely undiscovered until now.

      <p>After working with Professor Pallavi Narayan for one short month (for the course The Power of Things: Critical Writing Objects in Art and Culture), I can say that her teaching extends beyond the classroom. Every museum visit and exhibit viewing came with valuable insight, personal thoughts and opinions from her which helped us build our own interpretations with confidence. Writing a 6000-word essay in 30 days seemed to be a daunting task but Professor Narayan guided me through it with ease, offering feedback when required and pointing me in the right direction. The classroom never felt like a place the students just had to listen in, it was always interactive and engaging, every moment contributed to both my paper and me as an individual. As someone with little to no experience in writing such papers, I would not have been able to write one that I am genuinely proud of without Professor Narayan’s guidance and support. 
      <b>—Niveditha Sreedhar, undergraduate student, Ahmedabad University</b></p>
      
      
      
      <p>The course The Power of Things: Critical Writing on Objects in Art and Culture explored what the significance of an object is in art, museums and theatre with particular emphasis on writing academic papers, structuring work creatively and adding interesting perspectives to one’s detailed papers with a continuous flow of thought. A major part of the course was understanding research papers written on the topic by multiple authors, analysing their style of writing and using that in one’s own work and also citing references appropriately.
      The course was incredibly engaging because all the text in the course pack provided was explained and discussed in class by the faculty. The course taught me how to broaden my thinking in terms of what I write by expanding on a simple idea and delving deeper to explore its complexities. Museum visits and art gallery visits gave me a better idea of how objects interact with one another in a museum space and what great significance they hold in  their memory. An extremely fascinating aspect of the course for me was how each course participant had a different take away and subject of focus; I chose to write about objects and memory, another participant wrote about light as an object, someone wrote about how objects perform and another wrote about spaces and objects; each of these perspectives gave an object a lot of depth; it gave them an “objective.”
      The assignments and in class activities were engaging and essential to understanding the topic and expanding on our individual papers as well. Notable among these were activities like thinking from the point of view of an object, presenting a family object, presenting one’s own artwork, going to an art gallery or museum. The learning outcomes for me personally, were understanding how to write an academic paper, learning what it meant to expand upon a complex idea and realising the interrelation between objects and memory.
      Professor Narayan fostered a learning environment marked by intellectual rigor and mutual respect. Her openness to multiple approaches of the same topic enhanced the learning outcomes of the course. Having published her own work and also currently working on researching museums, the information shared from her experiences of museums all around the world were incredibly insightful and gave better meaning to the course. The enthusiasm of exploring museums and art galleries was contagious and made me even more interested in this course. Her detailing in PowerPoint presentations were intriguing and made one think deeply about the topic; an example being placing a border onto the cover slide showing what “frames” do in a museum and what the absence of a frame does. Her knowledge about citations was helpful and made the paper more academically accurate. Her feedback on every assignment was consistently insightful and constructive, contributing meaningfully to my academic growth and helping me build a wonderful final paper.
      <b>—Nandini Mehta, undergraduate student, Ahmedabad University</b></p>
      
      
      <p>Dr Pallavi Narayan made me feel both challenged and supported from our very first class. Her warmth and insight had a real impact on me as a student and writer. Her attentiveness, and clarity made her class one of the most engaging and intellectually grounding experiences of my first year.
      I had the opportunity to be her student when I undertook her course The Power of Things: Critical Writing on Objects in Art and Culture, a first year interdisciplinary seminar course at the Ahmedabad University. She opened my eyes to new ways of thinking about objects, meaning, and representation. Her knowledge of English and Museum studies brought depth to every discussion, and her feedback helped me write with more confidence and clarity.
      What stood out the most to me was her willingness to extend thoughtful guidance when I struggled with concepts, taking time for meaningful conversations that extended our class discussions, and consistently encouraging me to dig deeper into my ideas rather than settling for surface-level thinking.
      Her genuine interest in my growth as a thinker and writer was evident in everything from her detailed comments on papers to her willingness to explore questions that didn't have easy answers. I will always remember her mention of “The Magic Number 3” analogy: a simple yet powerful tool that transformed how I approach structure and clarity in my writing. She changed how I approach ideas, and I'm grateful to have been her student.
      <b>—Arya Patel, undergraduate student, Ahmedabad University</b></p>
      
      
      <p>Learning from Professor Narayan was a thought-provoking experience. She encouraged us to think outside the box, and push boundaries while still maintaining the academic rigor and framework required to bring those challenging ideas into mainstream discussions. She was open about her own personal experiences and creative endeavors, and initiated one-on-one interactions designed to focus on addressing individual student needs. She was always willing to answer questions or indulge relevant tangents, so long as it led to deeper critical thinking. Her course The Power of Things: Critical Writing on Objects in Art and Culture served as an introduction to formal academic writing for a lot of us, and her attention to detail and patience are greatly appreciated in providing us with long-lasting clarity and a strong foundation to build upon.

      <p>Enrolling in the Communication Skills course taught by Dr Pallavi Narayan was both a memorable and enriching experience. With the help of the course on reading comprehension and formal writing, I realized how to organize the thoughts coherently and how to represent the arguments logically. As a result of different literary works, critical reading, and multimedia sources, I had a chance not only to enhance my academic writing skills but also to learn to think critically and communicate more clearly and confidently.
      The active and interactive classes were also one of the most influential parts of the course. Dr Pallavi always attempted to engage students in discussion and hear their opinion, therefore, creating the atmosphere of an open dialogue and making us consider the problem specifically through the lenses of another student. This did not only improve my learning but also made me confident that I can write about my own thoughts and beliefs in a systematic and meaningful manner. 
      The teaching method of Dr Pallavi was all round dynamic. She would assign us pre-readings to discuss in the classroom, and we would have engaging, intellectual arguments that helped simplify challenging subjects. The use of groups in activities was common in the course, thus making learning collaborative and fun. She would provide feedback on assignments which was extensive and very constructive and the grading system was out of 10 which made it very easy to keep track of the progress and know the areas where we could have done better. 
      The most impressive thing was the way she made each class positive and motivating. With her encouragement and participation, the rest of us found it very easy to participate and remain active throughout the semester. I deeply appreciate having had the opportunity to be in her class—it was definitely one of the best parts of my academic life to date.
      <b>—Namrashi Patel, undergraduate student, Ahmedabad University</b></p>
      
      
      <p>I had the privilege of studying under Dr Pallavi Narayan in my second semester (Winter 2025) for the Communication Skills course. She was engaging in her teaching approach and displayed an earnest, thoughtful, and nurturing attitude toward the class. The atmosphere she provided in the classroom promoted self-confidence and inquisitiveness, thereby aiding me in polishing not just academic skills but also general communication skills.
      Throughout the course, Dr Narayan was always approachable and willing to provide guidance with issues pertaining to assignments, class discussions, or more broad aspects of learning strategies. Her feedback was always such that I could understand it—something constructive, and motivating—therefore heavily bearing on my academic performance. I was proud to score 89 out of a total of 100 and attain a perfect 4.0 GPA for the course.
      Dr Narayan truly left an indelible impression on me for the commitment she gave toward seeing her students flourish inside the classroom or outside of it. I am thankful for the opportunity to have learned from her.

      <p>I wanted to take a moment to share how much I appreciated your Communication Skills classes. Your teaching style was not only engaging but also incredibly effective. Each session was filled with meaningful learning, and your approach of “learning by doing” made a real difference in how we absorbed the concepts. One of the most memorable classes for me was the one on citations. What usually feels like a complicated and dry topic became simple and enjoyable thanks to the fun activity you designed. It truly showed how teaching can be both creative and impactful. Thank you for making the subject so interesting and for always encouraging us to participate actively. I  genuinely looked forward to every class and learned a lot from you.

      <p>My Communication Skills class taught by Professor Pallavi Narayan was a the memorable ones. I initially did not think this was something I needed but the class in of itself was much different than I expected. We explored many different aspects of communication and essay writing and Professor Pallavi helped us understand the different types of essays and how to employ them. All in all, my interactions inside the classroom were fruitful and Professor Pallavi helped me in many aspects outside the realms of Communication Skills as well. Moreover, outside the classroom I enjoyed talking with her about different literature and writing styles as she helped me try to write in a more personal style, as opposed to my logic-centric writing.
      <b>—Aksh Madhu, undergraduate student, Ahmedabad University</b></p>
      
      
      <p>I truly miss my Communication Skills lectures with you, thank you so much for making the classes so much fun and interactive. In the entire semester yours was the class I was always excited to attend. Thank you so much for always helping me with the smallest of queries and for all the personal doubt-solving sessions. I have gained a lot of confidence in both, reading and writing after attending the course with you. You are the sweetest professor.

      <p>This is to express my sincere gratitude for your invaluable guidance and support through your teaching. I not only learned how to write structure and thoughtful essays, but also began to think critically and explore ideas from various disciplinary perspectives. Your encouragement helped me improve my both to express myself clearly and effectively. The lessons I learned in your COM101 class have had a lasting impact on my academic growth, and I am truly thankful for the knowledge and confidence you instilled in me.

      <p>I am writing to express my gratitude for organizing and hosting yesterday’s discussion as part of the Ahmedabad Writing Programme conversation series. As an attendee, I found the conversation incredibly enlightening and thought-provoking. The opportunity to engage in dialogue about your book <i>Pamuk's Istanbul: The Self and the City </i> alongside was genuinely enriching. The insights shared regarding representations of the city in fiction, the significance of museums (both fictional and real), and the complexities of identity construction in Istanbul provided me with a deeper understanding of the subject matter. The discussion allowed me to view the issue through a different lens. For instance, while reading the newspaper in the morning, I came across an opinion piece titled “#AccessibleIndia: Can Mughal History Inspire Modern Inclusion?” I wanted to take a moment to share some reflections inspired by an article I read in today's Indian Express regarding accessibility and inclusion, particularly in the context of heritage sites and public spaces. The article highlighted the importance of creating inclusive environments, drawing attention to the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities in accessing public accommodations and roads. It resonated deeply with me, especially after attending the recent discussion on <i> Pamuk’s Istanbul </i> and reflecting on the significance of representation and accessibility in cultural spaces. Drawing from Pamuk’s discussion, where we explored representations of the city in fiction and the concept of identity construction, I could not help but see parallels with the barriers faced by individuals with disabilities in navigating physical spaces, just as Pamuk’s character navigated the cultural landscape of Istanbul. Thank you for creating spaces for these critical conversations and inspiring us to think critically about these issues.
      <b>—Hasti Vagadia, undergraduate student, Ahmedabad University</b></p>
      
      
      
      <p>I remember first interacting with Professor Narayan after a talk in my first year as a PhD student and being interested in her course titled The City in World Literature. I had been really excited when I heard that a new faculty of literature, who had written a book on Orhan Pamuk had joined the university. I was on the lookout for an interesting course and I found her course to be fascinating. I am a student who is interested in urban studies and the different perspectives of studying the urban. I had never engaged with literature, as a way to understand the urban. The course itself was enriching because of four main reasons. Firstly, it covered major cities, which I had not studied so far—such as Karachi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Seoul, Dubai, and Johannesburg. Secondly, the course not only engaged with these cities from the perspective of literary texts, but also introduced us and pushed us to think about important concepts of social science such as decolonialism, diaspora, marginalization and othering, world literature and modernity, different lenses to understand the city and what we read about. Thirdly, her guidance in terms of writing was extremely important for me. One of the assignments, which involved response papers, improved my writing significantly. She would read through each and every line, and would give me really important feedback. She was extremely patient, as I slowly, but surely learnt under her tutelage how to write critically, linking observations with theory, as well as linking arguments into a coherent piece of work. Fourthly, her second assignment, which was equally memorable, was that of digital mapping. How to map out spaces given in a literary piece onto a digital space and narrate a larger story? Professor Narayan pushed us to think out of the box and create outputs which transcended the boundaries of texts and maps and produce something new, something original. It was not only that her sessions were engaging and participatory. 
      Professor Narayan also organized multiple book talks and invited speakers whose works were contemporary. There are two which I distinctly remember: the first one was a panel discussion on her book, titled <i> Pamuk’s Istanbul </i> and the second, a talk by Chandrahas Choudhury on the importance of literary education. Professor Narayan has been a constant source of support for me outside class as well, encouraging me to meet new people and reading more and I am thankful to her for the same.

      <p>Professor Dr Narayan, thank you for the enriching and thought-provoking session. As someone who has always cherished literature, today's session felt like a return to some of my treasured moments of being a literature student. I truly appreciate the way you made the complex reading on complex and uneven development accessible and stimulating. I wish we had more sessions to look at it in detail.
      Thank you also for sharing your experiences and anecdotes with us! They added depth and perspective to our discussion, making the material even more meaningful. Our session encouraged me to reflect deeply and articulate what I believe are pressing questions in psychology and global mental health. I am especially grateful for your openness in allowing us to voice out our thoughts.
      I look forward to more reading opportunities with you in the future.

      <p>Professor Narayan, I really enjoyed the session you took in the Key Concepts in History and Philosophy course. The part I liked the most was that you came to our level to help us understand important concepts in the texts we missed while reading. Not only this, but the real-life examples from your research experience just made it more engaging. I wish you had more such sessions in this course. I also want to thank you for this insightful class.

      <p>I am writing to express my gratitude for our last session of Key Concepts in History and Philosophy—it was immensely helpful. Since we are working through a difficult reading, your approach of contextualizing it with examples made the process much smoother. It also allowed me to reflect on the text through my own vernacular literature, which made the discussion even more engaging.

      <p>I would like to [thank the Ahmedabad Writing Programme, its Director, Professor Pallavi Narayan … for the opportunity to spend time here at Ahmedabad University and in the historic city of Ahmedabad, with its old and new structures, stories and divisions, the hot furnace of late April fragrant with neem blossoms and skies dramatic with cumulus clouds. Like all old cities, I know the real Ahmedabad exists somewhere between its past and its future, the real and the imagined. I have had a glimpse of the realities and possibilities of Ahmedabad in these two weeks and it has whetted my hunger to see more of it, know it better, attempt to understand and memorialise it authentically.
      This chance to spend time writing and interacting with the community …, an environment intellectually stimulating and conducive to the discipline that the practice of writing requires, is special and I hope more universities in India offer such residencies. I wish the ... community all the best and look forward to future opportunities to engage.

      <p>Being invited as a writer-in-residence by Ahmedabad University’s Ahmedabad Writing Programme is a privilege. It has enabled me to commit to the singular, focused act of writing each day, without any distractions. Not only does the residency offer a quiet space to write, it also helps facilitate valuable interactions with professors on campus and provides access to a plethora of books at the library. Although a fortnight may not be enough to engage with the city at a deeper level, the opportunity has given me an impetus to admire the city’s architecture, its heritage, and learn about the many stories that thrive within it.
      I am truly grateful to Ahmedabad Writing Programme's Director, Professor Pallavi Narayan … for offering this special residency. I am certain it will immensely benefit writers who desire unbroken
      time for crafting their stories, while also finding inspiration in a historic city like Ahmedabad. I am thoroughly enjoying my time here and I look forward to future collaborative opportunities ...
